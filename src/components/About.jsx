            Our primary focus is on advanced at-home cancer screening. Our
            flagship product is designed to identify a specific biomarker
            uniquely present in cancer cells, enabling earlier detection of
            multiple types of cancer with a single test. This streamlines the
            process and enhances convenience for you. By identifying cancer
            cells at an early stage, we provide essential information that
            supports effective management and treatment. This unique approach
            allows us to offer a broader range of cancer detection than
            traditional tests, giving you a valuable tool for proactive health
            management.
